# 📘 EV Adoption Growth in India (2020–2024)
### *Data Analytics Project by Rishant Singh*

## 📝 Project Overview
This project analyzes the growth of Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption across India over the last five years.  
Using official EV registration data from the **VAHAN Portal**, I cleaned the dataset, calculated YoY growth, CAGR, and totals, and built an **interactive Tableau dashboard** to visualize national and state-wise EV trends.

This project helped me understand real data cleaning, growth analysis, and dashboard-building skills.
